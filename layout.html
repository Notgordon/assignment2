  Paragraphs are wonderful things and the most wonderful thing about paragraphs is the paragraphs are
  wonderful things. They begin, they have a body, and then they close. When there's something to be
  written and there's much to be said about a topic a paragraph is a surefire solution. Yes, I do love them.
  Pictures too. But I want them both in one convenient location. Not on top one another. Somehow I want you
  to see that I am talking about the picture provided without having to articulate that it's above me.
  
  </p>

  <p>
  What if I added another paragraph? I've already solved the image issue. Maybe I should just type words and hope
  that nobody actually reads this. That's a safe bet. If you were reading this you'd think I was just spouting out
  nonsensical gibberish. We don't want that to happen! I'm taking this class seriously, I mean it. I'm just having
  a little fun. Clear as a crisp spring morning, F-K in the coffee.
